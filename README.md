You can install a Chrome extension from a GitHub repository by loading it as an unpacked extension. Here's how to do it:

1. Click the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP".
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a folder on your computer.
3. Open Google Chrome and go to the Extensions page by either entering chrome://extensions in the address bar or clicking the three-dot menu, then choosing "More tools" > "Extensions".
4. Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top-right corner of the Extensions page.
5. Click the "Load unpacked" button in the top-left corner.
6. In the file explorer window that opens, navigate to the folder where you extracted the extension files, and click "Select Folder".
7. The extension should now be installed in your Chrome browser as an unpacked extension, and you can use it as you would any other extension.

Keep in mind that loading an unpacked extension in this manner is intended for development and testing purposes. The extension will not automatically update to newer versions, and you'll need to manually update it by downloading the new version from the GitHub repository and reloading the extension.
